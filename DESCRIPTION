Version: 0.2.15
Date: 2015-11-13
Author: Christopher Adolph
Description:  Calculate counterfactual expected values and first 
              differences for a variety of statistical models 
              (e.g., linear, logit, probit, multinomial logit, ordered probit,
              log-linear models, linear models with lagged dependent variables), 
              along with confidence intervals.  Useful for producing inputs to tile
              graphics such as ropeladder and lineplot.  (See Zelig 
              for different and extensive facilities along these lines.)  
              Also includes numerous utility functions.
